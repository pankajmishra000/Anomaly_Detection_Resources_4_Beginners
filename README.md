# Anomaly_Detection_Resources_4_Beginners
**Curated List of resources for the Anomaly detection task for the beginners. The work is created in the paradigms of academic requirements of University of Udine, to assist the new grad students in this field.**

# What is [Anomaly Detection?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection)
**In Simple Terms**: Anomaly detection is defined as the identification of samples which significantly differ from a reference set of normal data, under the assumption that the number of anomalies is much smaller than the number of normal samples.
**In more rigorous terms**: From a rigorous point of view the problem is not well defined, as there is no rigorous formalization of the properties this difference should have in order to be considered significant: the definition of anomaly is often dependent on an arbitrarily-defined threshold.

However,from a practical point of view, anomaly detection is a widespread problem, marking strong presence in the fields of medical imaging, network intrusion detection, defect detection, fault prevention, video surveillance, and many others. In medical imaging an anomaly could be a tumor tissue among several data of healthy patients, in quality-assurance industrial inspection it can be a defective product, in the surveillance videos of a shopping mall it can bethe behavioral pattern of a thief compared to normal
clients, etc. Hence, practically anomalies can be of three types :
* Point Anomaly
* Collective or Group Anomaly
* Contextual or Conditional Anomaly
*The below image shows the definition with an example of all three.*
